# Trends in How Millennials Perceive and Engage with Insurance Services in 2023

## Introduction

Understanding millennials’ attitudes and behaviors toward insurance is critical for insurers aiming to capture this large, digitally savvy segment. In 2023, millennials—defined here as those born between 1981 and 1996—continued to reshape the insurance landscape with distinct perceptions of risk, strong digital preferences, and evolving engagement patterns. This report synthesizes findings from authoritative industry reports and surveys, focusing on five key dimensions: risk perceptions; insurance ownership and need gaps; purchase drivers and barriers; digital adoption and channel preferences; and trust and education. Each section draws on primary data from LIMRA’s "2023 Insurance Barometer Study," the Society of Actuaries’ "Perceptions of Younger Generations on Risk and Insurance," Western & Southern’s "Life Insurance Knowledge Gap" report, PYMNTS Intelligence, and BCG’s global survey.

## Risk Perceptions and Tolerance

Millennials display moderate risk aversion, which shapes their insurance engagement. In the SOA survey, half of younger consumers consider themselves risk-neutral, while more lean toward risk aversion than risk tolerance. Those classified as risk-averse prioritize affordability and cost when purchasing insurance, whereas risk-tolerant individuals exhibit higher trust in insurers and are more likely to hold accident insurance (32*). ([soa.org](https://www.soa.org/498900/globalassets/assets/files/resources/research-report/2023/young-gen-private-ins.pdf))

Between 60% and 80% of millennials expressed concern about various financial and insurable risks, with accidents (both auto and otherwise) and health-related costs ranking highest (22–25*). Despite high concern, they often perceive the likelihood of adverse events as lower than their level of worry, indicating a disconnect between perceived risk and concern.

## Insurance Ownership and Need Gaps

### Life Insurance

According to LIMRA’s 2023 Insurance Barometer Study, 50% of millennials reported owning life insurance, matching Gen X (53%) but trailing Baby Boomers (63%) ([limra.com](https://www.buaweb.com/files/82398/the_file/2023_insurance_barometer_study.pdf)). Among insured millennials, 21% indicated insufficient coverage, contributing to a 41% life insurance need gap among all adults—unchanged since 2021 but reflecting persistent underinsurance among younger cohorts. ([limra.com](https://www.buaweb.com/files/82398/the_file/2023_insurance_barometer_study.pdf))

Western & Southern found that 54% of millennials have an active life insurance policy. Yet only 26% regularly consult their insurer or advisor, and 40% rarely review their policies, highlighting an engagement deficit post-purchase. Millennials were also most likely (38%) to believe life insurance is solely useful after death, underestimating living benefits like cash value accumulation.

### Other Coverages

Millennials are most likely to hold auto (87%) and health insurance (88%) and least likely to own critical illness (15%), disability (20%), and accident (22%) policies. Six in ten intend to purchase additional insurance within 12 months, with half preferring online purchase regardless of type. Cost and coverage priorities outweigh carrier strength or convenience. ([soa.org](https://www.soa.org/498900/globalassets/assets/files/resources/research-report/2023/young-gen-private-ins.pdf))

## Purchase Drivers and Barriers

Cost remains the top barrier to insurance adoption for millennials, cited by 45% of non-owners as the reason for not purchasing life insurance. Lack of product knowledge (25%) and perceived low need also inhibited uptake. Overestimation of insurance costs contributes to the gap—only 24% of consumers correctly estimate term life premiums. ([limra.com](https://www.buaweb.com/files/82398/the_file/2023_insurance_barometer_study.pdf))

Mandated or ‘necessary’ purchases—such as auto and home insurance—are nonetheless valued: 47% of millennials who bought home insurance did so out of perceived need, not merely requirement. Such intrinsic valuation suggests messaging that emphasizes personal relevance can drive engagement. ([soa.org](https://www.soa.org/498900/globalassets/assets/files/resources/research-report/2023/young-gen-private-ins.pdf))

## Digital Adoption and Channel Preferences

Digital convenience is paramount for millennials. PYMNTS Intelligence reports that 50% prefer online platforms for research and policy purchase, yet nearly half still seek a human touch—valuing expert advice before finalizing decisions. Two-thirds would choose instant digital payouts for claims, underscoring expectations for seamless digital experiences. ([pymnts.com](https://www.pymnts.com/insurance/2023/young-consumers-insurance-purchasing-mantra-digital-convenience-human-touch))

BCG’s global survey echoes these findings: omnichannel journeys are now the norm, with millennials gravitating toward aggregators and insurer websites for quotes but relying on agents for purchase. Younger respondents place greater emphasis on product flexibility and customer experience than price compared to older generations.

### InsurTech Engagement

Majesco notes that data and AI technologies attract millennials, who expect personalization and real-time interactions. Embedded insurance and usage-based models, such as telematics for auto, resonate strongly with this cohort. Insurers who integrate protection into broader digital ecosystems (e.g., e-commerce, mobility services) stand to capture millennial interest. ([majesco.com](https://www.majesco.com/blog/gen-z-and-millennial-buyer-insurance-trends-point-to-the-importance-of-data-ai-technologies))

## Trust, Education, and Ongoing Engagement

Millennials rate insurer trust around six out of ten—more are optimistic than skeptical, yet there is ample room for improvement (soa.org, 31–32*). Western & Southern highlights that only 40% review policies regularly, and 60% never consult advisors post-purchase. Misunderstandings around terminology, coverage scope, and policy benefits persist: 38% of millennials lack confidence in their product knowledge, and 20% confuse life insurance with health or retirement products. ([westernsouthern.com](https://www.westernsouthern.com/life-insurance/life-insurance-literacy-in-america))

Ongoing engagement through digital platforms, social media educational content—where 75% seek financial advice—and easy policy management tools can strengthen trust. Personalized nudges for policy reviews following life events (e.g., marriage, home purchase) can address underinsurance and knowledge gaps.

## Conclusion and Recommendations

In 2023, millennials’ insurance behaviors reflect a blend of cautious risk management, digital-first expectations, and enduring demand for human expertise. Insurers can thrive by:

- Streamlining digital omnichannel experiences with instant transactions and AI-driven personalization.
- Emphasizing transparent, relatable educational content via social media and apps to demystify products and costs.
- Embedding insurance offerings within broader digital ecosystems and leveraging data for tailored risk solutions.
- Proactively engaging policyholders through automated reviews and life-event triggers to close coverage gaps and reinforce value.
- Balancing digital convenience with accessible human advice, ensuring millennial consumers feel supported throughout their insurance journey.

By aligning products, channels, and communications with millennial preferences, insurers can deepen engagement, improve coverage adequacy, and secure loyalty from this pivotal generation.
