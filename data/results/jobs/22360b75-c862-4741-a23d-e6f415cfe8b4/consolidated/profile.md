## Executive Summary

Millennials represent a significant and digitally adept segment with evolving expectations toward insurance products. Findings from the GWI insights illustrate that in markets such as Australia, Canada, and the USA, Millennials are notably more inclined toward mobile and cyber insurance, demonstrating a 31% and 48% higher likelihood of purchase respectively than the average consumer [Source: audience-insights-gwi].

## Psychographic Analysis

Millennials are characterized by their distinctive attitudes toward risk, trust, and value. Their psychological profile, as evident from the combined research, highlights several key attributes:

## Conclusion

This comprehensive profile underscores that Millennials are not only digitally native but also demand a level of personalization and transparency that challenges traditional insurance models. Their behavior—marked by a clear preference for digital channels and a pronounced focus on personalized, flexible insurance products—requires insurers to be agile and innovative.
