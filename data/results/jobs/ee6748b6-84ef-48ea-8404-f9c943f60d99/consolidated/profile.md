• **Knowledge Gaps in Advanced Insurance Features**:  
  - With digital innovations such as telematics still not fully understood by over half of Gen Z respondents, there is a notable need for increased digital education and clearer explanations of complex insurance products [Source: advanced-web-research].

================================================================

## Opportunities & Recommendations

• **Enhance Digital Platforms for All Insurance Lines**:  
  - Insurers should invest in more intuitive, responsive, and dedicated digital platforms, especially for automotive insurance where Gen Z is notably less engaged online [Source: audience-insights-gwi].  
  - Enhancements should include a seamless quote-to-policy process, easy claims management, and responsive customer support to reduce the friction that leads to policy switching [Source: advanced-web-research].

• **Prioritize Mobile and Health Insurance Products**:  
  - Given the 87% inclination towards mobile insurance and the 24% higher purchase rate for health insurance among Gen Z, insurers should tailor their product portfolios to expand these offerings.  
  - Introducing simple, app-based purchasing and management interfaces could better meet Gen Z’s needs and drive higher adoption of these products [Source: audience-insights-gwi; advanced-web-research].

• **Invest in Digital Education and Transparency Initiatives**:  
  - With 54% of Gen Z uncertain about advanced features such as telematics, creating easy-to-understand educational content is essential.  
  - Using digital channels like social media, interactive video series, or webinars can demystify product complexities and build consumer trust [Source: advanced-web-research].

• **Implement Data Privacy and Security Assurances**:  
  - To overcome privacy concerns, insurers must clearly communicate their data usage policies and ensure robust digital security measures are in place.  
  - Offering visible privacy safeguards and providing options for consumers to control the sharing of their data can help mitigate the skepticism around automated and personalized insurance processes [Source: advanced-web-research].

• **Introduce Flexible, Usage-Based Pricing Models**:  
  - As cost sensitivity is a significant factor, usage-based models that align premiums to actual behaviors or usage metrics can greatly appeal to this demographic.  
  - This model not only adds a layer of personalization but also resonates with Gen Z’s need for budget control and fairness in pricing [Source: advanced-web-research].

• **Integrate Ethical and Sustainable Practices**:  
  - Aligning product narratives with ethical values can engage Gen Z on a deeper level. Insurers might consider offering green incentives, such as discounts on electric vehicle insurance or sustainable claims practices, to address Gen Z’s environmental concerns [Source: advanced-web-research].  
  - Transparency around these initiatives should be part of broader corporate messaging, reinforcing authenticity and commitment to social responsibility [Source: advanced-web-research].
