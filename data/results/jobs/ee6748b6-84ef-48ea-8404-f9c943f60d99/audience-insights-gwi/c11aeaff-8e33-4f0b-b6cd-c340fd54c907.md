# GWI Audience Insights Report

## Executive Summary

The insights into Gen Z's insurance purchasing behaviors across several countries reveal distinct preferences and opportunities for insurers targeting this demographic. Notably, only 15% of Gen Z have purchased car insurance recently, and they are 24% less likely to do so online, indicating a potential gap in digital engagement strategies for automotive insurance providers. However, Gen Z's strong inclination towards health insurance, with a 24% higher purchase rate than the average, suggests a prioritization of personal well-being. Additionally, Gen Z shows significant interest in mobile insurance, being 87% more likely to consider purchasing it soon, reflecting their digital-first lifestyle and reliance on mobile technology.

These findings suggest that insurers should enhance their digital platforms to better engage Gen Z, particularly for automotive insurance. Furthermore, expanding and tailoring product offerings in mobile and health insurance could capitalize on their clear interest in these areas. Introducing innovative cyber insurance products might also appeal to Gen Z's growing awareness of digital security, despite the current low purchase intent. Overall, a strategic focus on digital engagement, mobile technology integration, and personalized, relevant insurance offerings could effectively capture and retain Gen Z customers.
