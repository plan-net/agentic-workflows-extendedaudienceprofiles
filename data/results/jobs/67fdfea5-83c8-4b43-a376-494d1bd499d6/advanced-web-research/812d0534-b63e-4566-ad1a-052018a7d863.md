# Social Media Habits and Key Influencers of Millennials in the Sustainable Fashion Sector

## Introduction
Sustainable fashion has emerged as a pivotal movement reshaping consumer values and industry practices, with millennials (those born between 1981 and 1996) at its forefront. This report delves into the social media behaviors that drive millennials’ engagement with sustainable fashion and highlights the influential figures shaping these conversations. By synthesizing insights from industry reports, academic studies, and reputable web sources, this analysis offers a comprehensive view of how millennials interact with sustainable fashion on social platforms and who they follow to inform their choices.

## Social Media Habits of Millennials

Millennials exhibit distinct preferences and usage patterns across social platforms, reflecting their dual role as digital pioneers and discerning consumers.

### Platform Usage and Time Spent
Millennials are prolific social media users, investing significant daily time online. A 2025 Sprout Pulse Survey found that millennials average 2 hours and 25 minutes daily on social media, surpassing Baby Boomers but trailing Gen Z’s 3-hour average (Crop Ink).¹ On specific platforms, Sprout Social data indicates 85% of millennial social media users are on Facebook, 80% on YouTube, and 74% on Instagram, making these channels primary venues for entertainment, connection, and information (Sprout Social).²

### Content Preferences and Engagement Drivers
Millennials gravitate toward content that balances authenticity, utility, and emotional resonance. They seek shared experiences, such as cultural moments and practical "hacks," over ephemeral trends (Sprout Social).² On Facebook, they engage most with text-based brand posts, while on Instagram they favor short-form videos under 15 seconds, and on YouTube they prefer long-form video content over 60 seconds (Sprout Social).² Across platforms, the hallmarks of content that capture millennial attention are authenticity, entertainment value, and reliability, with a strong aversion to overtly sales-driven messaging (Sprout Social).²

### Emerging Platforms and Community-Driven Spaces
While legacy platforms remain central, millennials are early adopters of niche, community-oriented networks. In mid-2025, 63% planned to use Reddit, and 57% aimed to embrace alternate decentralized networks like Bluesky, Threads, and Mastodon, often spurred by influencer migrations and niche interest communities (Sprout Social).² These platforms offer spaces for deeper dialogue on values-driven topics, including sustainable fashion.

### Social Commerce and Research Behaviors
Millennials increasingly turn to social media for product discovery and purchase decisions. Nearly 30% use social channels as primary search engines for product reviews and recommendations, particularly for sustainable fashion items (Sprout Social).² Over half report making impulse purchases inspired by social content at least once monthly, and 35% say they’re likelier to buy items discovered on social in the current economic climate (Sprout Social).²

## Sustainable Fashion Engagement Among Millennials

Millennials’ commitment to sustainability is reflected in their purchasing behaviors and willingness to pay premiums for eco-conscious brands. Research indicates 66% of millennials are willing to spend more on sustainable brands, underscoring the generation’s economic influence in the sustainable apparel market (Statista).³ Their digital engagement with sustainable fashion content further amplifies this impact, as they share, comment on, and create content around eco-friendly practices.

Academic literature highlights social media’s transformative role. A systematic review of 92 studies found that platforms like Instagram, Twitter, and TikTok serve as pivotal channels for sustainable fashion discourse, enabling activism, brand-led campaigns, and peer-to-peer knowledge sharing (Zhou et al., Journal of Global Fashion Marketing).⁴ The rise of "deinfluencing"—where creators discourage unnecessary purchases—reflects millennials’ critical stance toward overconsumption (Zhou et al.).⁴
